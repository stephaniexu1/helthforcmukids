# helth for cmu kids
## Hack 112 Spring 2021 Project

Hello friends!

This is my very short (quite janky) game called “helth for cmu kids.”

“helth for cmu kids” aims to promote healthy habits for our fellow CMU students by helping them correctly identify healthy food from junk food. I forgot what the name of the game is called, but it’s inspired by one of those catching-stuff-in-a-bowl game and my Tetris code :-)

The game is pretty easy to play: use the left and right keys to move the scottie bowl and press space to pause the game. Earn points by catching the healthy foods - that is if you can identify them correctly - and lose points by not catching healthy foods (shameful) or catching junk foods (bad). There are fun easter eggs incorporated, so look at the terminal because randomly generated messages will be printed depending on the move you make. The game ends when you score below a 0, so don’t goof up and beware the spiciness. Also, the longer you play the game, the more points you earn by catching healthy foods because this probably means you’re an expert at identifying healthy foods now! :D 

Long story short, please eat healthily and stay healthy… otherwise expresso depresso.
